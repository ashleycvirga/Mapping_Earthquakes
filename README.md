[![Stand With Ukraine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vshymanskyy/StandWithUkraine/main/banner-direct.svg)](https://stand-with-ukraine.pp.ua)

I have added this banner in honor of Volodymyr Agafonkin, Ukrainian citizen and developer of Leaflet.js, and the team of Ukrainian developers who continue to maintain Leaflet.js, without whom this project would not have been possible.
